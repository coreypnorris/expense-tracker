##Expense tracker

####This is a javascript app designed to help you keep track of your expenses.

To use it just download the zip file and open the index.html file in your web browser of choice. Enter a category of expenses that you’d like to keep track of and hit enter. Then click on the category to bring up the form for entering specific expenses.

I built this project while I was a student at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). This exercise was meant to teach us about [Using common object-oriented patterns in different apps](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/using-patterns-in-address-book-and-to-do-list
). In a previous app we built an [address book](https://github.com/coreypnorris/address-book). Now we’re applying those principles here, in an expense tracker.
